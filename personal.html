            We are <a href="http://www.attachmentparenting.org/">attachment parents</a>, which basically means that we strive to create a nurturing environment by being present for our son and treating him with love and respect.  Seems to be working so far...
          </p>
          <p>
            Our son is also a Montessori child, which we believe gives him confidence through independence.  He's been going to a Montessori school since he was about a year old.  Seems to be working so far...

            My house came with a 2400 sq. ft. organic garden in the back yard.  It's been both an important inspiration and a great disappointment to me, often at the same time.  For some reason the idea of a pouring my blood, sweat, and tears into the earth and being rewarded with the freshest possible fruit and veg really strikes me.  There's also something about being able to grow at least some of my family's food that satisfies my provider instinct.

            I'm currently planning a relatively large compost system and thinking about converting my irrigation system from sprinklers to drip.  Big plans...

            I've been homebrewing for maybe 10 years now, everything from stovetop extract brews to 15 gallon all grain batches.  I have a four-tap kegerator in the garage but these days I don't often get the free time to brew properly since large propane flames, vats of boiling wort and rambunctious children don't really mix all that well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm using a converted cooler for mashing and two 20 gallon stainless steel tubs for boiling water and wort.  Everything's connected with food-grade silicone tubing fitted with quick disconnects for hooking up to my 7.2 gpm high temperature brewing pump.  I'm really pleased with my system at the moment, with the exception of clean-up time.  My next investment will probably be a nice stainless conical fermenter.

            I got tired of bottling my beer, so I now use five gallon soda kegs carbonated with forced CO2.  My legs are stored in an old refrigerator I converted into a four-tap kegerator.

            I've always been compelled to understand how things work, even if that means taking them apart to find out.  As a very young child my parents learned to keep the wrenches and screwdrivers well hidden so I wouldn't take our Speak 'n Spells and Betamaxes apart.  I consider myself lucky to have been born with an inquisitive and logical mind that's driven me toward a life in software engineering.

            I wrote my first functioning program on an Apple IIC at about the age of five.  It was a simple goto routine that printed my name to the screen in an infinite loop, but something clicked inside my brain that day and I've been hooked ever since.  I remember copying programs character by character from the pages of computer magazines to my computer, thrilled to be able to make letters and numbers on a screen turn into games and pictures.  My parents encouraged my interest in computers by getting games that taught me about circuits, logic gates, etc.

            The age of the internet crept into my life in late middle school or early high school.  I remember connecting to BBSs on my 2400 baud modem before we had an ISP.  I built my first web page in 1995, complete with repeating background images and flashing text.  Since then, I've built countless web sites and applications in so many different technologies it would be hard to list them all here.
